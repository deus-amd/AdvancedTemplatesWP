#Windows Phone 8.1 Advanced Template Pack
This is a powerful pack with 2 ready to use Windows Phone 8.1 applications templates. These templates allow you to design applications with top bar and/or a slide menu without copy&paste them to each page of the application.

###Features

#####Menu

  - **Global slide menu**: one menu, for entaire application
  - **Swipe ready**: menu open and close with a simple gesture, everywhere in the app
  - **Flexible**: menu content can be defined for each page or for all the application
  - **Customizable**: menu is a simple UIElement container, you can put in it everything

#####TopBar
  - **Global top bar**: on the top of each page without horrible C&P
  - **Flexible**: one content for entaire application or one for each page
  - **Customizable**: top bar is a simple UIElement container, you can put in it everything

#####Better coding
C&P menu and top bar in each page is a waste of time and performance. With these template the elements are defined *one time* in a root frame container. The application (Frame) is *inside* this container. You can edit container for customize the global experience, or "develop normally" to build pages.
